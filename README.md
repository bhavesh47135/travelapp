This is an app I have developed entirely by myself, named "TourIt", designed to help tourists to London find popular 
tourist attractions, directions around the city and travel information. This app was created for my Third Year
Undergraduate Individual Project at University. The app is very simple and has been developed entirely using HTML/JS
without the use of any additional frameworks.
