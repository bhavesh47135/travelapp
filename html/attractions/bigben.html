                Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of 
                Westminster in London and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower. The official name 
                of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 
                to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When 
                completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. 
                The tower stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, 
                measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet (7.0 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations 
                were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.
