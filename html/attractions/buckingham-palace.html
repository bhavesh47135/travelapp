                Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. 
                Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. 
                It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. Originally known 
                as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of 
                Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by 
                King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During 
                the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three 
                wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the 
                accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.
